--- Original Description ---
Updated to B18. Apologies for delay, wife is pregnant and that takes priority. :)
Incorporating aspects from Frank Herbert's excellent Sci Fi series, Dune.

Forgive the silly sandworm drawing. :)

This initial release is designed as a testing bed to make sure the essentials are in game and working. Essentially, this release contains the following:

-- Fremen. Tribes spread throughout the land. Basic functionality, traders, etc.
-- Weapons. Basic fremen weapons. A short automatic carbine, crysknife, long rifle, and the weirding module (not on any NPCs).
-- Tech tree. Very basic. First tier access to weapons / stillsuits. Second tier access to spice refineries and the weirding module.
-- Spice. Granted, slightly overpowered. But, Frank Herbert basically made this drug overpowered in the Dune series as well. Designed to allow colonists to function in the extreme / desert environments. Suppresses hunger rate. Will be expanded in the future. Find raw spice in the desert, harvest it, and refine it, or buy it from Fremen Traders.</description>
